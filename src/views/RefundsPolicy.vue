        <p class="description">
            NexTash offers refunds on products and services within a specified
            timeframe from the date of purchase. The eligibility period may vary
            based on the type of product or service.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">Refund Requests</h2>
        <p class="description">
            To initiate a refund request, please contact our customer support
            team at <a href="mailto:support@nextash.com" class="link">support@nextash.com</a>
            within the specified
            eligibility period. Provide your order number, a detailed reason for
            the refund request, and any supporting documentation, if necessary.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">Non-Refundable Items</h2>
        <p class="description">
            Certain products or services may not be eligible for a refund. These
            include, but are not limited to, digital downloads, customized
            products, and services that have already been rendered.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">Processing Time</h2>
        <p class="description">
            Once your refund request is received, we will review it and notify
            you of the approval or rejection of your refund. The processing time
            may vary, but we strive to complete the review within 15 days business
            days.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">Refund Method</h2>
        <p class="description">
            Approved refunds will be processed using the original method of
            payment. Please allow 15 business days for the refund to be
            reflected in your account.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">Cancelled Orders</h2>
        <p class="description">
            If you cancel an order before it is processed, a full refund will be
            issued. However, if the order has already been processed, it will be
            treated as a standard refund request.
